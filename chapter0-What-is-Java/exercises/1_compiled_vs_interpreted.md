#### Compiled

* Code that you write that needs to be compiled (Java, C#, C++) before being run.
* Compiling translates the code into machine-code.
* Faster at runtime.
* Needs to be free of errors in the compile stage before it can be used - these errors will come up when being compiled, e.g. if a function is being used incorrectly in the program.



#### Interpreted

* Code that is compiled at runtime (Ruby, Python, JavaScript).
* Slower at runtime due to the time it needs to compile.
* Do not requireÂ machine code in order to execute the program.
