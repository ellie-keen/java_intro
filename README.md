# An Intro to Java
A set of exercises as an introduction to Java including a FizzBuzz exercise.

Through completing these exercises and researching into Java I now have:

- A high-level understanding of how different languages work
- De-mystified what a compiled language is
- Set up an environment for Java
- Used docs and stackoverflow to learn a new language
- Create, compiled and run Java programs
