Delve a little deeper, do some research, and find out what do the following mean:

`public`: declares a member's access as public
`class`: a template for creating different objects which defines its properties and behaviours.
`static`: denotes that a variable, or method can be accessed without requiring an instantiation of the class.
`void`: the method has no return value
`main`: you need to have a method named main in at least one class
The main() function then calls all the other functions required to run your program. Similarly, in the Java language, when you execute a class with the Java interpreter, the runtime system starts by calling the class's main() method. The main() method then calls all the other methods required to run your application.

___
`System`: A class in the java.lang package.
`out`: a variable
`println`: a method
`System.out.println`: a Java statement that prints the argument passed into the System.out which is generally stdout.
